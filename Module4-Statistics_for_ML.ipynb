        "1. **Descriptive Statistics**:\n",
        "   - Provide a basic summary of the data (mean, median, mode).\n",

        "3. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
        "   - Involves comparing observed data against the null hypothesis.\n",
        "   - Interpreting a p-value requires considering the study context and the predetermined significance level (commonly 0.05).\n",
